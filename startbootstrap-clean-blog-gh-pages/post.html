                        <h2 class="section-heading">I can remeber this day like it was yesterday</h2>
                        <p>It was the crack of dawn and I was going to be a big kid with my brother. I rember that yellow dress and the friends I had made. But the best part of that day was when I came home. My mom was waiting with choclate cupcakes that she had made. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-clean-blog-gh-pages/first day of kindergarden.jfif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is my favorite picture of my brother and I</span>
                        <p>I think Kindergarden is scary to every kid. It might have been worse for me becuase this would be my first time truly away from my mom. She had worked at my preschool. But I had my big brother so I was okay</p>
                    
                        <h2 class="section-heading">We are going to jump across the country now</h2>
                        <p>I loved soccer. From the first time I played in second grade, all the way through high school. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-clean-blog-gh-pages/soccer in fourth grade.jfif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Lexi and I after our soccer game</span>
                        <p>A really hard challenge for me was getting picked up for a team that my friends werent on. I think this was important for me, to know that my friends would still be there. To know that I could make new friends and branch out</p>
                        <p>Lexi and I played against eachother in this game. I dont remember who won but I do remember our dads taking us out for ice cream after. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Graduation started the second chapter in my life</h2>
                        <p>We all have to grow up and leave home at some point. This was not something I was excited to do. With the support of friends and family, leaving became the best thing I have ever done.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../startbootstrap-clean-blog-gh-pages/graduation withthe girls.jfif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">My people </span>
                        <p>Graduation was the saddest and happiest day of my high school experience. Scared to leave my friends, excited to go off and make new ones. I was a cliche who cried when my ebstfriend got her diploma.  </p>
                        <p>After losing most of our high school experience to covid we were eager to spend the summer filling it with adventures. Its safe to say we did not waste the freedom. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My home away from home</h2>
                        <p>I have never been so excited to move somewhere in my whole life. And to look back on the scared freshmen we once were, I can safely say Gonzaga was the best choice I have ever made. </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="./first day in our apartment.jfif" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Some of the best friends you will ever make will be in college.</span>
                        <p>These are my people. My family away from home. My college roommates will be my bridesmaids one day. On the left is Julia, then Me, Hannah, and last but not least, Erica. </p>
                        <p>These girls know me better than anyone else in the world. There is no shortage of laughs or inside jokes. I can not believe how lucky I was to find them.</p>
                        <p> Here is my favorite song!
